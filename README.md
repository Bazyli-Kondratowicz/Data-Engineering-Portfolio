#Python Projects

##Project 1 -  Extract Contact Information from Large Documents

Roadmap:
* Get the text from the clipboard.
* Find all phone numbers and email addresses in the text.
* Paste them onto the clipboard.
    - The code will need to do the following:
        * Use the pyperclip module to copy and paste strings.
        * Create two regexes, one for matching phone numbers and one for matching email  addresses.
        * Find all matches (not just the first match) of both regexes.
        * Neatly format the matched strings into a single string to paste.
        * Display some kind of message if no matches were found in the text.
